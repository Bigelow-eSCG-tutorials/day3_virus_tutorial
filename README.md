#### Identification of viruses and other pangenomic elements within SAGs

In this tutorial we are focusing on viruses from plates AG-910.

Notebooks 1, 2 and 3 will take you through virus searching for and curation of viruses within an indivial SAG.

To get started, open a terminal and navigate into your working directory:

```
cd ~/storage/userlab/{your name here}
```

then clone this github repository:  

```
git clone https://github.com/Bigelow-eSCG-tutorials/day3_virus_tutorial.git
```

and navigate into this directory in terminal:

```
cd day3_virus_tutorial
```

Navigate into this directory in the jupyterhub navigation pane on the left side of your screen, select ```1_finding_phages.ipynb``` to open it in a new window in jupyterhub and let's find some viruses.

#### Virus Finding
[VirSorter2](https://github.com/jiarong/VirSorter2):
```
source activate /mnt/storage/envs/vs2
virsorter run -i ${contigs_fasta} --include-groups "dsDNAphage,ssDNA"
```

[DeepVirFinder](https://github.com/jessieren/DeepVirFinder):
```
source activate /mnt/storage/envs/dvf
python /mnt/storage/envs/opt/DeepVirFinder/dvf.py -i ${contig} -o ${plateout} -c ${cpus}
```
---
### Identification of initial candidates

Results from the above workflows were merged, contigs were maintained as initial viral candidates based on the following criteria:
* VirSorter2: max_score = 0.9, hallmark genes > 0  
* DeepVirFinder: dvf_score_min = 0.9, dvf_pvalue_max = 0.05  

---
### Candidate initial QC
Initial virus candidate contigs were then extracted and written to a new fasta file and examined by CheckV:

[CheckV](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/checkv/src/master/)
```
source activate /mnt/storage/envs/checkv
checkv end_to_end $infa $outdir -t 20 -d /mnt/storage/reference_dbs/checkv/checkv-db-v1.5
```


---
### Annotation

[DRAM](https://github.com/WrightonLabCSU/DRAM)

```
source activate /mnt/storage/envs/dram
DRAM-v.py annotate -i ${contig} -o $plateout --min_contig_size 2000
```
